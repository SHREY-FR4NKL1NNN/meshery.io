In the dynamic world of open source software, where innovation thrives on collaboration, opportunities for contributors to showcase and validate their expertise are continually expanding. The Meshery project is thrilled to announce the launch of the Certified Meshery Contributor (CMC) program—a robust certification initiative crafted to acknowledge and authenticate the proficiency of developers actively shaping the Meshery ecosystem.

## About the Certification

The [Certified Meshery Contributor (CMC) certification](https://cloud.meshery.io/academy/certifications/c5ada327-8a58-4c8a-b9fa-51b95696488c/certified-meshery-contributor) validates technical proficiency in contributing to the Meshery open source project through written, performance-based assessments. The certification consists of five distinct exams, each dedicated to one of Meshery’s major architectural domains: Meshery Server, Meshery CLI, Meshery UI, Meshery Models, and Meshery Extensibility.

Tailored for developers possessing intermediate skills in Go, React, and OpenAPI schemas, and with hands-on experience in Meshery’s codebase, this certification affirms an individual’s capability to make substantial contributions to project development. This includes adept code implementation, thorough testing, seamless integration, and strategic optimization.

## Introducing the Certified Meshery Contributor Program

The Certified Meshery Contributor program is part of the broader [Meshery Certification Program](https://cloud.meshery.io/academy/certifications), which offers a structured pathway for professionals to validate their skills in managing and contributing to Meshery. The program includes certifications for administrators, developers, and open source contributors, each tailored to different levels of expertise and roles within the Meshery ecosystem.

The program is organized into tracks for Administrators, Developers, and Community members, featuring progressive tiers to support ongoing professional development.

### Scores needed to pass exams

All exam scores are reported on a percentage basis, with a passing threshold of 70% or greater. Exams vary in the number, type, and complexity of questions. While questions may be uniformly weighted, they can also differ in point value based on difficulty, as determined by exam creators. Unless specified otherwise, each question holds equal value (typically two points). Passing is determined by demonstrating the requisite knowledge, skills, and competence, considering question difficulty.

## A Compliment to Meshery’s Existing Recognition Program

Our [recognition program badges](/blog/2023/09/2023-9-2-layer5-badge-program/) are a tangible way for us to recognize and honor the exceptional efforts put forth by our contributors and the milestones achieved by our users. These badges are a representation of your participation and milestones that you achieve together and in solidarity with the Meshery community. Badges are how users demonstrate their prowess with the projects and how contributors identify their ownership, dedication, and skills. There are several badges each representing a specific user achievement or contributor skill.

Currently, the Badges program includes:

* **Achievement Badges**: Entry-level (e.g., "Shipped" for first deployment).  
* **Project Badges**: Contribution-focused (e.g., "Meshery Catalog").  
* **Community Badges**: Soft skills (e.g., "MeshMate" for mentoring).  
* **Certification Badges**: Advanced, like the existing MeshMaster badge, which recognizes a "clear and holistic understanding of cloud-native infrastructure management."
